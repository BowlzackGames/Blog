            <h1>I hate linkedIn</h1>
            <p>The idea to write this post first came to me when I was, like every giga-chad programmer, going through my daily morning routine in Pok√©mon Go. All of a sudden I noticed that I had a notification from linkedIn. Usually, I swipe these away as if they were angry mosquitos buzzing around my head, but this morning was different, I clicked on the notification out of an unexplainable curiosity.</p>

            <p>I had received a connection request from a person who works at a place I previously worked at, let's call this previous employer Shlomidithai. Anyways, this is not the first time I've gotten a connection request from a random person on linkedIn, but it's the first connection request that triggered me to start my own blog, so let's get into why I hate linkedIn, and maybe why you should too.</p>

            <h2>Random connection requests</h2>
            <p>This one is an easy one but still an annoying part of the site. Now keep in mind, I don't mind people trying to connect with me on linkedIn, but it should be with a purpose, and not like the shitty or low-effort connection requests I'll get into.</p>

            <h3>The mysterious stranger</h3>
            <p>This is the most common connection request I get. A random person who may, but in most cases doesn't have anything to do with me nor does this person have anything that connects them to me. I guess it's kind of a lottery. Accept the request, and you may be glad you did. From my experience though, you won't hear a peep from that person. Full disclosure, this is the type of connection request that triggered all of this, so if you recognize yourself, please stop.</p>

            <h3>The Messiah</h3>
            <p>This person is usually a young-ish guy contacting you because they have a fantastic idea that will make them money. And lucky for you, they've chosen you, most likely because you have a skill on your profile that they've read a bit about online, to work your ass off and make that dream come true. But don't worry, you'll be well compensated with absolutely nothing and will most probably be treated like you've been a naughty employee.</p>

            <h3>The confused recruiter</h3>
            <p>This one is my favourite. A poor recruiter desperately trying to fill a position. They may have stumbled upon your profile. Reading through your, let's say front-end heavy profile, they make the obvious conclusion that you'd love to work with a Java back-end using JSF in the front-end. I have more to say, but I think it fits better in the section below...</p>

            <h2>Recruiters</h2>
            <h3>The river of messages</h3>

            <p>So, let's get into recruiters. The first thing that comes to mind are the messages. Each time you log in, you have 10+ messages from recruiters. Once in a blue moon, someone has made some effort and written something great that captures your attention. But most of the time it's all just copy-paste.</p>

            <h3>Sucking at their job</h3>
            <p>Now, it may seem harsh to say, but most recruiters suck at their job. I know this because I've been quite lazy when it comes to finding new jobs. And for a lazy person looking for a low-effort solution, recruiters are great (see? It's not all just negatives), in theory at least. Sure, they might align you with some job you get. But in my experience, it's been more of selling me the place, rather than the work or the people being a good fit for me. Even worse is if the recruiter you work with has no interest, or is unable to understand your needs and what drives you. The worst offenders by far are people from a company that we can call "Migel Drank". Now don't get me wrong, there are good, even great recruiters out there. A fantastic one, Raz, really understood the company she was recruiting for and understood me. She had a passion and a drive and could see clearly as day how well I would fit into the company I work at today. And honestly, I'm not sure I'd find or even be interested in that company if it wasn't for her. Also, talking to her was like talking to a good friend you haven't spoken to in a while. I might write another blog post about what makes a great recruiter from a developer perspective.</p>

            <h2>The feed and the people</h2>
            <p>By far the worst thing to do on linkedIn is to scroll through your feed. It's filled with bullshit posts from companies pretending to care about shit, or dumbass "inspirational" stories that make me throw up in my mouth a little when I read them. Now, fine, you may really be grateful for a job someone gave you and maybe you really are thankful for being given an opportunity to x, y and z. You may even have fooled yourself into thinking that the people you work with are your real friends, but trust me, as soon as you change jobs none of these people will ever reach out to you. But by far the posts I hate the most on the site are the posts where people compete who can go down on themselves the longest.</p>

            <p>Now, linkedIn wasn't always this way. I remember when I first used the site way back. People shared useful articles, people were helpful and there was a sense of community. What later happened on linkedIn is also the same thing that happened to Facebook. Remember when old people weren't on Facebook? Remember the time when it was actually cool (I know right? xD) to be on Facebook? Well, now linkedIn is the same as Facebook. It's a kind of site where if you post that your pet passed away, a lot of people would only react with a thumbs up and your aunt would comment with a "lol", not realizing it in fact doesn't stand for "Lots of love".</p>

            <h2>Effect on workers</h2>
            <p>The last thing I'd like to talk about what really, really makes me hate linked is the people who are employed/looking for employment. Everyone's trying to pad out their profile to look like the most competent, interesting and ambitious person in the world, And I really think it devalues every worker. We're giving companies a buff√© of candidates to choose from, all trying to outshine eachother and thus, giving companies all the power. All you can do is hope that in an interview process, you stand out enough to be noticed. And in my opinion, that's fucking idiotic that we do that to ourselves :).</p>

            <p>In conclusion, I'd just like to say that I'm learning neoVim now Btw.</p>
