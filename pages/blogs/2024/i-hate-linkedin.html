            <h1>I hate linkedIn</h1>
            <p>The idea to write this post first came to me when I was, as every giga-chad programmer, going through my daily morning routine in Pok√©mon Go. All of the sudden I notice I had a notification from linkedIn. Usually I swipe these away as if they were angry mosquitos buzzing around my head, but this morning was different, I clicked on the notification out of an unexplainable curiousoty</p>

            <p>I had revieced a connection request from a person who works at a place I prevously worked at, let's call this previous employer Shlomidithai. Anyways, this is not the first time I've gotten a connection request from a random person on linkedIn, but it's the first connection request that triggered me to start my own blog, so let's get into why I hate linkedIn, and maybe why you should too.</p>

            <h2>Random connection requests</h2>
            <p>This one is a easy one but nevertheless, still an annoying part of the site. Now keep in mind, I don't mind people trying to connect with me on linkedIn, but it should be with a purpose, and not like the shitty or low effort connection requests I'll get into.</p>

            <h3>The mysterious person</h3>
            <p>This is the most common connection request I get. A random person who may, but in most cases doesn't have anything to do with me nor does this person have anything that connects them to me. I guess it's kind of a lottery. Accept the request, and you may be glad you did. From my experience though, you won√§t hear a peep from that person. Full disclosure, this is the type of connection request that triggered all of this, so if you recognize yourself, please stop.</p>

            <h3>The messiah</h3>
            <p>This person is usually a young-ish guy contacting you because they have a fantastic idea that will make them money. And lucky for you, they've chosen you, most likely because you have a skill on your profile that they've read a bit about online, to work your ass off to make that come true. But don't worry, you'll be well compensated with absolutely nothing and will most probably be treated like you've been a naughty employee.</p>

            <h3>The confused recruiter</h3>
            <p>This one is my favourite. A poor recruiter desperately trying to fill a position. They might have read on your profile that you have a skill you obviously know little about or don't like. And if that's the case, that's a bit on you to be honest. But better yet is if they've completely misunderstood what you do and just send you a copy-pasted message </p>

            <h2>Recruiters</h2>

            <h2>The feed and the people</h2>

            <h2>Effect on workers</h2>
